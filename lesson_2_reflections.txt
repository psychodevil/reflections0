What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It is like a folder except that the files that I choose are tracked for changes.
To keep track of changes to the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the place that you put files before making a commit. So you add files that you think will make a logical change to the commit.
It adds more control over what I will get into the commit
