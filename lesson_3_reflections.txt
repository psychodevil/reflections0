When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I can not access my local repo or when I want to add a readme file

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual always gives me more control over the content that is to be set

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks copy the content from a github repo to my github account, but keeps track of forks
clones copies the content from a github repo to my local machine
branches is a divergent from the master branch to change the content
